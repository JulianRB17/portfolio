          I have a theater direction, production and acting background: I know
          my way with words, I know how to administrate and I know how failure
          is just a step to achieve a goal.

        <p className="hero__description">
          As someone with a theater background I have studied for a long time
          human interactions, human condition and experimenting with concepts
          and feelings through my body or the bodies of other people. I have
          found the same possibility as a web developer: the possibility of
          creation, not on the human body but through a language that
          materializes itself on a screen. The origin is the same: how to do
          this?

          Human creativity is the basis to our development.

        <p className="hero__description">
          It was not easy for me to be here: I believe in hard work and in
          discipline as the basis of creation. The ability to imagine works only
          when we dedicate ourselves to our work.
