            As a teenager, I dreamt of being Batman or inventing a flying car
            like Doc Emmet Brown. I longed to create something remarkable. Then,
            BOOM! I fell in loveâ€”not just with a girl but more profoundly with
            theater. It became a space where I could explore humanity, reality,
            and poetry through my body. Yet, something was still missing.

            Years flew by, and then another BOOM: 2020 hit. During that time, I
            embraced our collective vulnerability. Without the chance to connect
            with others physically, I sought a new avenue for my creativity. I
            revisited my younger self, and he had an idea. I delved into coding,
            starting with HTML and CSS, which were relatively straightforward.
            Then JavaScript opened a world of endless possibilities. React
            introduced structure, and NodeJS revealed complexity. So, here I am,
            a unique blend of theater and coding. Let's dive into the world of
            code together!
